Project Description: Student Feedback System using JDBC
The Student Feedback System is a simple application that allows students to provide feedback on courses they have attended. The system is implemented in Java and uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with a MySQL database. This project aims to demonstrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a database through a console-based Java application.
